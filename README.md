## üìú Description:
Word Cloud is a data visualization technique used for representing text data in which the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance.

Significant textual data points can be highlighted using a word cloud.

Word clouds are widely used for analyzing data from social network websites.

We are generating wordcloud from a text file that contains some words, we iterate over all the word and store the frequency of the word in an map, which is then passed to the wordcloud generator function which generates the wordcloud for us.
